This project is the result obtained by my team (Emmanuel and I: CIMAT) at the CroCoDL challenge of the ICCV 2025 Large Scale Cross Device Localization workshop. Essentially we proposed a solution based on the high quality MegaLoc embeddings for image retrieval together with a local reconstruction and camera pose estimation with VGGT plus a final light bundle adjustment. We got the fourth place. Go to the [github repo](https://github.com/sergio-alberto-dlm/visual_localization)
