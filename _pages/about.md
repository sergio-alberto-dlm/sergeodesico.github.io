I did my master's degree in Computer Science. I am interested in Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Robotics. My long-term goal is to develop learning-guided,
uncertainty-aware 3D perception algorithms capable of operating in dynamic, cluttered scenes—in real
time and within a continual learning framework.
